Based on the presented data, here are some brief trading recommendations:

1. **High-Risk High-Return Strategy** – Invest in cryptocurrencies with high volatility like 'bnb' and 'sol'. They have high volatility indicating higher risk but they also have potential for higher returns.

2. **Stable Investing Strategy** – Invest in cryptocurrencies with low volatility like 'lbtc' and 'ugold'. Their low volatility suggests less risk but also less potential for big returns. 

3. **Trending Cryptocurrencies** – 'bnb', 'btc' and 'sol' have been showing consistent upward trends in their prices.

4. **Diversification Strategy** – Diversify your investments across multiple cryptocurrencies. For example, 'btc' and 'eth' show high correlation. Investing in both will minimize the risk if one underperforms.

5. **Risk Aversion** – Avoid 'ctb', 'ugold' and 'wrsol'. They appear to have no trading activity.

Note: This analysis is based on the given data. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and unpredictable. It is important to research thoroughly before making any cryptocurrency investment decisions.
