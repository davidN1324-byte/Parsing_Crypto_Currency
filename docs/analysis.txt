This data gives us information about 13 different crypto assets: 'bch', 'bnb', 'btc', 'ctb', 'eth', 'lbtc', 'ltc', 'sol', 'steth', 'ugold', 'wbtc', 'wrsol', and 'wsteth'. Three key parameters are given for each asset: volatility, trend, and moving average. Crypto assets with a high value for volatility are more risky. The trend value indicates whether the asset's value is currently increasing or decreasing. A positive trend indicates an increasing value, a negative trend indicates a decreasing value. The moving average provides a smoothed value of the asset's costs, reducing the impact of short-term price fluctuations.

Based on this information, the trading recommendations would be as follows:

1. 'bnb' has relatively high volatility, which indicates a potential good pick for short-term trades given a strong increasing trend and a large moving average. But it's also riskier to invest in due to price fluctuations.

2. 'btc' is showing a strong positive trend and high volatility, which indicates that it might be a good choice for short-term investment/ trading, but not for a long-term investment due to its high risk of loss.

3. 'ctb' has exceptionally low volatility, which can indicate a more stable investment. However, it also shows zero trend, which indicates that its value doesn't increase or decrease significantly.

4. Holding 'eth' and 'steth' could be beneficial in the long term given the high price (moving average) and their trends which indicate a decreasing value, which might be a temporary trend for such prosperous assets.

5. For 'ltc' and 'wsteth', although they show a declining trend, the volatility is moderate, offering potential opportunities for buyers who are looking to hold long-term investments.

Please be aware that investing in cryptocurrency is often deemed risky due to their volatility and uncertainty, ensure to invest wisely and only with what you can afford to lose. Diversify your investment portfolio can also help distribute some of the risks.
