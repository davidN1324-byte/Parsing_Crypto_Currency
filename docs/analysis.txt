Based on the volatility, trend, and moving average values, the following recommendations can be made:

1. Bitcoin (BTC), Binance Coin (BNB), and Wrapped BTC (WBTC): These cryptocurrencies show positive trends (increasing in value over time). Their relatively low volatility values suggest they are not prone to extreme value fluctuations, making them relatively safe investments.

2. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Etherium (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC): Investing in these coins may be risky as they display negative trends, which means their value is decreasing over time. However, ETH and LTC show high correlation which suggests that the performance of one can predict that of another.

3. Cryptos with Zero Volatility: Cryptocurrencies such as CTB, UGold, and WRSOL have a volatility of 0 which could indicate that they are stable. However, the trends are also 0 which might suggest no significant gain or growth observed over the period.

4. Solana (SOL): This cryptocurrency exhibits a positive trend and also has a strong correlation with Bitcoin (BTC), which might suggest that when BTC's value rises, SOL's value might increase too.

Overall, if you are risk-averse, considering investing in BTC, BNB, and WBTC might be beneficial. However, you may want to refrain from investing in BCH, ETH, and LTC due to their negative trends unless you are willing to hold for the long term. Also, CTB, UGold, and WRSOL might not provide short-term significant gains due to their zero trends. SOL could be a beneficial investment based on its positive trend and strong correlation with BTC. 

Please note that investing in cryptocurrencies carries risk and you should only invest what you can afford to lose and always do your prior research or consult with an investment advisor.
