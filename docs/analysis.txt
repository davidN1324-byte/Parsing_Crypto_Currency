Based on the given data, here are some trading recommendations:

1. Volatility: High volatility means a higher risk, but it also provides potential for higher returns. The 'bch' seems to be the most volatile followed by 'sol', 'steth', 'eth', 'bnb' and 'ltc'. These currencies could be targeted if you are not risk averse and willing to take chances for high returns.

2. Trend: '-ve' trend suggests that the currency's price is going downwards and '+ve' that it is going up. The 'bnb' and 'lbtc' are showing a positive trend which means the prices of these cryptocurrencies are increasing. Hence, these two could be good for short-term investments. On the other hand, 'eth', 'bch', 'sol', 'ltc', 'steth', 'wsteth', 'btc', 'wbtc' are showing a negative trend and could be a good option if you are considering short selling.

3. Moving Average: It is widely used to identify price trends. The 'btc' and 'wbtc' have the highest moving averages, which implies that these currencies have been performing well for some time now. 

4. Correlation: Correlation shows if changes in one variable are associated with changes in another. A high positive correlation between two currencies suggests that they will likely move in the same direction.

Considering all aspects, if you wish to invest now and sell when the prices go up, 'bnb' and 'lbtc' are good options as they show an increasing trend. If you want long-term stable returns, 'btc' or 'wbtc' could be a safer bet as their moving averages are high. For high risk-high return strategy, investing in highly volatile currencies like 'bch', 'sol', 'steth' or 'eth' could be an option.

Again, these are purely data driven suggestions and it is always a good idea to consider other factors and your risk appetite before making investment decisions.
