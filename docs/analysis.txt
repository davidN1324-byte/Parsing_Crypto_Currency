Based on this data, below are the following recommendations for different cryptocurrencies:

1. BCH: With the highest volatility, it comes with higher risk. The severe negative trend (-16.96) indicates a falling market. Only for risk-taking investors.

2. BNB: Slightly high volatility but with a positive trend (4.10). This might indicate a possible growth.

3. BTC: Lower volatility, indicating less risk, but a slightly negative trend. Good for conservative investors.

4. ETH: High volatility and a negative trend. High risk and requires careful observation.

5. LTC: Fairly high volatility and negative trend, proceed cautiously.

6. SOL: Highest volatility and a large negative trend. Suitable for high risk traders.

7. WBTC: Low volatility and a slight negative trend. It has a strong correlation with BTC which is conservative.

Remember, correlation shows how much two cryptocurrencies are related. If correlation is close to 1, it means they have a high tendency to move in the same direction. If it's close to -1, they're likely to move in opposite directions. For diversification, pick coins that have low or negative correlation.

For portfolios with both BTC and WBTC, one might consider reducing one due to high correlation. If chasing high growth, BNB and BTC seem reasonable due to the positive trend.
