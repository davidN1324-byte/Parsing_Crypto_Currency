Based on the provided data, the following are the recommended trading strategies:

1. Since Bitcoin (BTC) has strong positive correlations with Etherum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB), diversifying among these three coins could spread the risks without compromising potential returns. 

2. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has a larger volatility than other coins such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Etherum (ETH). If you're a risk-seeking trader, this might be an attractive option. 

3. Those who prefer low volatility and steady appreciation might want to consider investing in Local Bitcoin (LBTC) which has much less volatility compared to other cryptocurrencies. 

4. Ethereum (ETH) and Staked Ether (STETH) correlate almost perfectly, which means they move together in almost the same direction. If you currently hold one, consider the other for diversification.

5. While SOL has a higher volatility that suggests greater potential for both profits and losses, it shows negative trends. This implies its recent price has been declining. Therefore, be cautious while investing in SOL unless you believe the trend will reverse. 

6. The stable coins like CTB, UGOLD, and WRSOL have a null volatility and have shown no change in trend, which indicate they may be a safe haven during volatile market periods, but they don't promise high returns. 

7. Although the trends are negative for ETH, BCH, LTC and several others, which means their recent prices are declining, it's also essential to analyze the reason behind this before making a decision. Sometimes, a temporary fall in price could be a good buying opportunity, if the future prospects look good.

Please keep in mind that this analysis is based purely on past price movements and trends and does not take into account other crucial factors you should consider before trading such as market news and your financial situation and tolerance for risk.
